# project_euler_solutions
My solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems, which is a cool platform with lot of problems to solve and the first way to start applying **Python** to something!

Please try to **solve the problems on your own**; do not use my solutions as yours, where would be the fun on that?
