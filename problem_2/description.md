Problem 2 : Even Fibonacci numbers
--------------------------------------

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


### SOLUTION

It has been created the function that returns the Fibonacci numbers up to 4 million, but it is included in the list returned those that are even.

Once the list with numbers is returned, it is obtained its sum
